Our project addresses the inefficiencies and security concerns of traditional attendance systems by integrating RFID technology with face recognition. 
By combining these technologies, we aim to create a more accurate, efficient, and secure attendance tracking solution for educational institutions, 
ensuring reliable identification of students while enhancing overall campus safety.

Problem Statement:

Traditional attendance tracking methods are prone to errors and inefficiencies.
Existing RFID-based systems lack robustness and are susceptible to security breaches.
Manual processes consume valuable time and resources, leading to inaccuracies in attendance records.
There is a need for an integrated solution that combines RFID technology with face recognition to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and security in attendance tracking.
Our project aims to address these challenges by developing an RFID and face recognition attendance device using OpenCV.
Components Used:

Breadboard and Jumper Wires
RFID Reader (RC522)
Alphanumeric LCD (20x4)
Arduino Uno R3
RTC Module
Camera Module
